ðŸŒŸ Image Generation for E-commerce (Colab Notebook)
ðŸ“– Project Overview
This Colab notebook demonstrates how to use generative AI (specifically GANs) to create high-quality product images for e-commerce platforms. It covers:

Augmenting product images with multiple angles and settings

Basics of virtual try-on concepts (conceptual or demo level)

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside?
GAN model implementation for product image augmentation

Sample image generation examples

Code cells ready to run on Google Colab â€” no local setup required!

âš¡ How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Run the cells sequentially to:

Load and preprocess sample product images

Train or load a pretrained GAN model

Generate new product images with diverse views

(Optional) Experiment with virtual try-on demo sections if included.

ðŸ’¡ Why Use This?
Easily augment your e-commerce product listings with diverse, high-res images

Experiment with generative AI without local GPU requirements

Build a foundation for advanced virtual try-on features

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The notebook requires a GPU runtime for efficient training and generation â€” enable it via Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU.

Depending on dataset size and model complexity, training times may vary.

ðŸ™Œ Feedback & Contributions
This notebook is a starting point â€” suggestions, improvements, and collaborations are welcome! Feel free to raise issues or contribute.
